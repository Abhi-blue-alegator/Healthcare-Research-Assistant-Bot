# Healthcare Research Assistant

This project is a Streamlit-based application that serves as a healthcare research assistant. It allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions based on the content of these documents. The application uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to provide answers to the questions.

## Features

- Upload PDF files to extract text content.
- Ask questions based on the content of the uploaded PDF.
- Receive answers generated by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- Ensure answers are relevant to healthcare and do not prescribe medications or substitute for a doctor's advice.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-research-assistant.git
    cd healthcare-research-assistant
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
    ```sh

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:**
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**
